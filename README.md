For Harvard's CS50 course, we had to create a homepage that met certain requirements for an assignment. I ended up creating a One Piece Fan Homepage or website based on the anime show I enjoy called "One Piece". This responsive website uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and also custom JavaScript code with DOM manipulation. Check it out!
