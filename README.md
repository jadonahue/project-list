# Project List
This is a list of projects I have created.


<h2><a href="https://jadonahue.github.io/one-piece-fan-page/">One Piece Fan Homepage</a></h2>
<p>
 For Harvard's CS50 course, we had to create a homepage that met certain requirements for an assignment. I ended up creating a responsive One Piece Fan Homepage or website based on the anime show I enjoy called "One Piece". This website uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and also custom JavaScript code with DOM manipulation. The About Crew page has a Bootstrap 5 carousel which goes over the Straw Hat's crew with a brief description. The Devil Fruit page has a JavaScript random generator that uses DOM manipulation to randomly select a Devil Fruit image along with the description. There are 41 different fruits it can select from. Check it out!
